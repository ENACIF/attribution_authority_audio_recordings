# The voice of Frida Kahlo? An acoustic-phonetic approach to the case


Abstract

This study examines a voice recording attributed to Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, which was discovered in the files of Mexicoâ€™s National Audio Archives (MNAA). The case gained attention when actress Amparo Garrido claimed that the voice in the recording was hers. Due to the absence of other known recordings of Kahlo's voice, this study tests the following hypotheses: that Garrido is the speaker (Hso) or that she is not (Hdo). To address this question, the Multivariate Kernel Density (MVKD) procedure was employed to analyze vowel formants. The system was then calibrated and validated with data provided by the MNAA, which reflects the conditions of the relevant population, as well as the questioned- and known-speaker recordings. A log-likelihood ratio of -1.404571 was obtained, providing moderate evidence against Garrido being the speaker.
